# ORM_Online_Reputation_Management

🧠 Online Reputation Management (ORM) – NLP Project
📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an Online Reputation Management (ORM) system using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The goal is to analyze user-generated reviews from the Google Play Store dataset (sourced from Kaggle) to identify sentiment trends — whether users express positive, negative, or neutral opinions about various apps.

Through this project, we aim to demonstrate how data-driven sentiment analysis can help companies track and improve their public perception.

🔗 Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps

🎯 Objectives

Extract and preprocess textual reviews from app data.
Apply NLP techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize sentiment distribution and frequent keywords.
Train and evaluate multiple Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest).
Fine-tune model parameters using GridSearchCV to improve accuracy.
Draw actionable insights to enhance a company’s online reputation strategies.

⚙️ Workflow

Problem Understanding – Define ORM goals and relevance of NLP.
Loading Libraries – Import essential Python packages.
Loading Dataset – Load, inspect, and clean app and review data.
Preprocessing – Tokenize, remove stopwords, and lemmatize text.
EDA – Visualize sentiment trends and word frequencies.
Model Training – Train and evaluate multiple classifiers.
Parameter Tuning – Optimize model accuracy with GridSearchCV.
Observations & Conclusion – Summarize findings and key insights.

📊 Key Results

Best Model: Logistic Regression (with L1 penalty and saga solver)
Accuracy: 91.2% (after tuning)
Insights: Positive reviews dominate the dataset, reflecting general user satisfaction with apps, while negative sentiments help identify key areas for improvement.

🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of NLP and Machine Learning in transforming unstructured text data into measurable insights.
By implementing this ORM framework, businesses can continuously monitor customer sentiment, enhance brand trust, and make informed data-driven decisions.
